# Python-Class-Inheritance-Training

Python Classes and Inheritance

This repository contains the code and materials for the three-week training course on Python Classes and Inheritance offered by Coursera and Michigan University. The course focuses on the fundamental concepts of classes, inheritance, unit testing, and exception handling in Python. All credits for the course content go to Coursera and Michigan University.
Course Contents

The course is divided into three parts, each covering essential aspects of Python classes and inheritance. The main topics covered in each part are as follows:

    Classes:
        Introduction to classes and objects in Python
        Creating and working with class attributes and methods
        Understanding encapsulation and data hiding within classes

    Inheritance:
        Exploring inheritance and its role in object-oriented programming
        Implementing inheritance hierarchies and parent-child relationships
        Overriding methods and accessing parent class functionality

    Unit Testing and Exception Handling:
        Writing unit tests using the unittest framework
        Handling exceptions and error conditions in Python
        Ensuring code reliability and robustness through testing and error handling

Course Project

At the end of the course, a project was assigned that combines the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the three weeks. The project involves implementing a simplified version of the game "Wheel of Fortune." The rules of the game are as follows:

    The game consists of both human and computer players.
    Each player starts with zero money and no prizes.
    The goal is to guess a phrase within a given category.
    Players take turns spinning the wheel to determine a prize amount.
    If the wheel lands on a cash square, players can guess a letter.
        Vowels (a, e, i, o, u) cost $250 to guess.
        Players earn money for each occurrence of the guessed letter in the phrase.
    Players can also guess the complete phrase to win the game.
    The game includes squares for "lose a turn" and "bankrupt."
    The game continues until the entire phrase is revealed or a player guesses the complete phrase correctly.

Documentation

To understand and implement the game project, please refer to the project description and rules mentioned above. There is no specific external documentation required for this project.
